# House-Prices-Kaggle-Challenge

### About

In this competition we use creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques to predict house sales prices. The full details of the competition can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

### Practice Skills

Creative feature engineering
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

### Goal

It is my job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, I must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Metric

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

### Submission File Format

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

Id, SalePrice
1461, 169000. 1
1462, 187724. 1233
1463, 175221
etc.

###Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
